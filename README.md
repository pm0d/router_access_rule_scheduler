# Configuring TP-Link WR740N Router from PowerShell

This is a personal project to update my wifi routerâ€™s configuration from PowerShell. 

I wanted a way to quickly block YouTube for a few minutes on my kid's mobile device whenever needed. 

Though the router provides options to set up access control through rules and schedules, it is a very tedious process. 

So I wrote this script to automate the process using Curl. 

I plan to add a few more features such as checking the router uptime, rebooting it, and checking active devices. 

You are welcome to use the script as you wish. Pull requests are welcome as well. Alternatively, you can open an issue if you find any. Thank you!
