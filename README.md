# Configuring TP-Link WR740N Router through PowerShell

A personal project to make changes to my wifi router configuration through PowerShell.

It all started when my kid kept watching too much YouTube on their mobile device. I needed a way to block YouTube for few minutes on the device each time.

The router provides options to setup access control through rules and schedules however updating the access rule schedule every single time from the router management page was very tedious process. 

Hence I have created this script to automate the process using Curl allowing me to update the schedule in a jiffy.

I also plan to add a few more features such as checking the uptime, rebooting the router, and checking active devices.

You are welcome to use the script as you wish. Pull requests are welcome as well. Alternatively you can open an issue if you find any. Thank you!
