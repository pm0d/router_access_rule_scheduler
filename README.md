# Configuring TP-Link WR740N Router through PowerShell

A personal project to automate the management of my wifi router through PowerShell.

It all started when my child watched too much Youtube on their mobile device and I needed to block the device for few minutes so that they would stop watching it. 

Opening a browser tab to navigate to the router management page, signing in, clicking through the router menu options and setting the schedule every single time was very tedious. So, I finally created this script to automate the process using Curl.

I also plan to add a few more features such as checking the uptime, rebooting the router, and checking active devices.

Please let me know if you find any issues or have any suggestions.. Thank you!
